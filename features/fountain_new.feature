Feature: As an admin
  I want to add a new fountain
  So that I can manage my applications data.

  @javascript
  Scenario: Add a new fountain

    Given there are some fountains
      And I am logged in as an admin
      When I go to the new fountain page
      And I fill in '111' for 'longitude'
      And I fill in '222' for 'latitude'
      And I click button 'Create'
      Then I should see '111'
